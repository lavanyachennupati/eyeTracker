Flip Warning Documentation

The following is a brief discussion about the warning that PTB may emit when 
running an experiment. After a run of an experiment, PTB will produce a message
in the MATLAB command window reporting that a certain amount of calls to Flip 
missed their presentation deadline. We spent quite some time researching this 
warning, and found no solution to it. We also conducted several timing tests to 
ensure that our code isn't distorting the synchronization of the system to the 
VBL, and found that it is not. Several of these tests involved experimenting 
with the function Screen('Flip') and we have recorded and documented all of the 
results of our experiments. When running our code on the same set of movies and
images against PTB's exemplary code, we found that they also encountered Flip 
misses, and not only that, but that our numbers were in close proximity. As a 
result of this, and the fact that the flip warnings does not distort playback 
quality in any apparent way, we decided to proceed, as our code is up to par 
with PTB's exemplary code. For detailed documentation and analyses of the data 
collected from our experiments, please contact Dr. Eakta Jain at
